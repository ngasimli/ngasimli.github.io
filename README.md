# About

My name is Nurlan Gasimli, and I am a fourth-year B.S. student in mathematics at Umass Lowell. 

My research interests lie in Algebraic and Differential Geometry, where I focus on Hodge Theory, algebraic cycles, and their applications in Algebraic Geometry. In Number Theory, I explore topics such as the Riemann Hypothesis, Langlandâ€™s Program, and the Arithmetic of Elliptic Curves.
